Dream
Everybody's got a goal and a dream 
Everybody's got a dream. Everybody's got a goal. What's the plan? Your plan has to be clear, concise, compelling, consistent and committed. You gotta have a plan. Don't go to bed without a plan of how you're gonna handle the next day. You have to work at it every day. You have to plan. Productivity has never an accident. I want you to understand that it's not gonna happen by luck. Success has caused an effect. Not magic luck or magic fairy dust. Success is easy. It's making a plan and executing the plan every day. Make a plan. Work the plan. Make a plan. Work the plan. And whenever the plan doesn't work, you change the plan.That's called failure. It's called learning a lesson. Called adjusting.
